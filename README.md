# 06Weekly-Challenge
Wanderlust Weather Application

I have provided a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN a user searches for a city
They are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN they view current weather conditions for that city
THEY are presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
They are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN they click on a city in the search history
THEN they again are presented with current and future conditions for that city
